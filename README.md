## Portfolio 

A small start to my first portfolio! Using just HTML and CSS this portfolio includes project samples for potential employers to view.
I have set up three main sections: about me, projects I have done, and how to go about contacting me! The nav bar will pull you to wherever 
you'd want with just a simple click. It also follows you as you scroll down (Desktop View). If you hover over a project the image will react by getting bigger than all the others. 
Website should be responsive to various screen sizes if displayed on different devices.
